# Mitigating-computational-bias-using-Fairlearn

This lab notebook explores the concept of fairness in machine learning, specifically addressing biases that may emerge when applying predictive models in sensitive areas like healthcare. Using the Fairlearn library, this notebook provides a step-by-step approach to identifying and mitigating computational bias in an AI system that predicts hospital readmissions for diabetes patients. The analysis focuses on ensuring equitable outcomes across different demographic groups, especially given the ethical implications in healthcare resource allocation.

### Key Sections and Highlights

1. **Introduction to Fairness in AI**  
   Fairness is crucial in AI applications, especially where decisions can affect people's lives. This section introduces fairness as a multidisciplinary field, describing common types of algorithmic harms, such as allocation harm, which can disproportionately impact certain groups. The notebook sets the context by explaining why fairness is essential in healthcare, where resource allocation needs to be equitable and justifiable.

2. **Dataset Overview**  
   The dataset used includes ten years of clinical data on diabetes patients, with records from over 130 U.S. hospitals, spanning 1998-2008. Each data entry represents a hospital stay for a diabetes patient, capturing information on demographics, healthcare interactions, and outcomes like readmission rates within 30 days. Key demographic attributes include race, gender, age, and admission source, which are carefully analyzed to identify potential biases or imbalances.

3. **Data Preprocessing and Exploration**  
   This section describes how the dataset is cleaned and processed, with missing data handled carefully (e.g., merging small racial groups into an “Other” category and removing records with unknown gender). The distribution of gender, age, and race is visualized and examined to understand representation across groups and how this might affect fairness in predictions.

4. **Task Definition and Label Validation**  
   The notebook defines the predictive task: identifying patients likely to benefit from high-risk care management. The target label—30-day readmission—is evaluated to ensure it aligns with this goal, with a focus on construct validity. This step includes analysis to confirm that the chosen label is predictive of the intended outcome, establishing its appropriateness for the task.

5. **Model Training and Baseline Performance**  
   A logistic regression model is trained to predict 30-day readmissions, with balanced accuracy as the performance metric to address class imbalance. Model interpretability is prioritized, as it enables better understanding and scrutiny of predictions. The initial performance of the model is examined, providing a baseline to assess the fairness interventions applied later.

6. **Fairness Assessment with Fairlearn**  
   Using the Fairlearn library, the notebook calculates fairness metrics, focusing on false negative rate (FNR) and selection rate across demographic groups. By disaggregating these metrics by race, the notebook highlights any disparities in how well the model performs for different groups, especially identifying where false negatives (missed high-risk cases) are disproportionately high.

7. **Mitigating Fairness-related Biases**  
   To address observed disparities, the notebook applies Fairlearn’s `ThresholdOptimizer`, a post-processing algorithm that adjusts model thresholds for different demographic groups to ensure parity in FNR. This step demonstrates how fairness constraints can be integrated into model outputs to reduce allocation harm and improve equitable outcomes. Metrics before and after mitigation are compared to illustrate the improvement.

8. **Datasheet Documentation**  
   To promote transparency, the notebook includes sections on dataset documentation, inspired by the "Datasheets for Datasets" practice. This documentation summarizes data sources, known limitations, and preprocessing steps, ensuring that any decisions made during model development are well-documented for future reference.

### Requirements

To run this notebook, the following libraries are required:
- `Fairlearn` for fairness assessment and mitigation
- `scikit-learn` for model training and evaluation
- `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

### How to Use

This notebook is designed for use in Google Colab or a Jupyter environment. After installing the necessary packages, follow the sections sequentially to:
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train a baseline logistic regression model.
3. Evaluate model fairness using disaggregated metrics.
4. Apply mitigation techniques and re-evaluate fairness.
5. Review and document findings to ensure accountability.

### Summary

By walking through each stage, from data preprocessing to post-processing mitigation, this notebook provides an in-depth tutorial on building fairness-aware machine learning models. It is a practical guide for data scientists and engineers looking to integrate fairness considerations into their workflows, especially in high-stakes fields like healthcare.
